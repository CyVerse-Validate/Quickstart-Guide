#Validate on Atmosphere
If you are already fimilar with Atmosphere then feel free to skip the rest of this paragraph. For a brief tour and overview of Atmosphere you can watch [this series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SCE1Vpm9CI&list=PL-0S9LiUi0vhXEADveTYEoKb8ua1aYIby) of youtube videos (which should take about ten minutes). After watching the videos, or in lieu of, there is also a well written quickstart guide [here](http://www.cyverse.org/atmosphere).

Now that you are all set with Atmosphere, there is one other thing we should mention before you jump into the Validate Workflow. If you are using Atmosphere to access the Validate Workflow you will need to have a basic knowledge 
of the Linux terminal commands. If you do not yet or simply want a refresher, please consult either [this tutorial](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) or [this cheat sheet](http://linoxide.com/guide/linux-cheat-sheet.png) to familiarize yourself. 

Finally, to remotely access individual instances, you will need to download [VNC Viewer software.](http://www.realvnc.com/download/viewer/) Simply choose the option that matches your computer, and follow the instructions.
