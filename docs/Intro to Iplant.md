##What is the iPlant Collaborative?

The iPlant Collaborative is a National Science Foundation (NSF) funded program devoted to developing a cyberinfrastructure for life science research. 
What is a cyberinfrastructure?

Put simply, iPlant provides the space and processing power necessary for the large-scale data analyses that biologists and other life scientists often use in their research.
The iPlant Collaborative is, as the name implies, a collaborative project between several universities around America including the University of Arizona, 
the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) at the University of Texas Austin, 
the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, and the University of North Carolina Wilmington. 

Beyond storage space and computing power, iPlant also provides an open-source platform for anyone to use, share, or build their own analysis tools. The community is friendly and welcoming to new users, and a
a special forum for asking questions is also set up on the site (think StackOverflow, but iPlant related).

Admittedly, the authors of this site have not used all of the tools iPlant has to offer, but others are welcome to add their own tutorials for certain topics.

#This site largely focuses on four of the iPlant services:
*	_[Data Store:](http://www.iplantcollaborative.org/ci/data-store)_ As you can likely guess, this is where everyone has access to their own personal storage space (up to 2 TB per person) along with
community data which can be used for sample analyses 
*	_[Discovery Environment:](http://www.iplantcollaborative.org/ci/discovery-environment)_ Not only ties in with the Data Store, but also hosts a wide variety of scientific applications that you may use freely, either
to analyze community data or your own
*	_[Atmosphere:](http://www.iplantcollaborative.org/ci/atmosphere)_ Your isolated cloud computing environment for launching your own software. The virtual machine (VM) also hosts a number of images with pre-installed
software and a number of options depending on your need of memory, processors, and storage space. You can also access the Data Store through the Atmosphere service.
*	_[Agave API](http://agaveapi.co/) and [Stampede:](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guides/stampede)_ The Agave API is the iPlant Collaborative's application programming interface for defining your own compute and
storage allocations. Beyond that, Agave also allows you to submit analysis jobs through existing applications or develop your own application to share with others. The entirety of the Agave system is powered by one of the world's
fastest supercomputers, Stampede, located at the Texas Advanced Computing Center.

We will cover these subjects a bit later on. For now though, we will take the next step and look at some terminology that may be useful to anyone working with iPlant.
