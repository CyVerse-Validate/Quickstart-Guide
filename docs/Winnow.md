#Winnow

The bread-and-butter of the workflow, Winnow (formerly the eponymous Validate), is a Python-compatible known truth testing tool for genome wide association studies. Quite simply, Winnow is a tool that evaluates other tools. 
Winnow requires output from a GWAS tool after analyzing a data set. Given the "known truth" of the original data set, Winnow outputs a series of fit statistics to determine 
the validity of the GWAS tool and whether or not it was truly useful in analyzing the data.
