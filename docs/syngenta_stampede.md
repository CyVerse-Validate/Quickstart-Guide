# Tutorial for running Validate using a sample data set.

This guide assumes you will be using Stampede to run the workflow. Validate may be ran on your own hardware by cloning from our github or setting up Agave locally.

## 1. Accessing Stampede

On a mac or linux system, simply ssh into Stampede using your TACC username and password.

~~~~~
ssh taccuserid@stampede.tacc.utexas.edu
~~~~~

After entering your password you will be placed on a login node on the Stampede system. 

Some basic familiarity with the linux CLI will be helpful. Try to make practice of typing commands rather than copy-pasting them.

Remember, you can type cd at any point to return to your home directory should you get "lost."

For full documentation for Stampede user access, please see [this link](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guides/stampede)

## 2. Downloading Validate


## 3. Accessing Syngenta data set


# Using Agave:

The Agave API provides a set of CLI tools for accessing the Cyverse data store and running apps on Stampede. Comprehensive instructions for configuring your client may be found [here](https://github.com/iPlantCollaborativeOpenSource/cyverse-sdk).
